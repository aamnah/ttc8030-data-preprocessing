# Exercises for Data Preprocessing [TTC8030]

## Jupyter Notebook shortcuts

- `ctrl` + `enter` - run cell
- `b` - new cell
- `d` twice - delete cell

See more shortcuts here: https://hantt.pages.labranet.jamk.fi/data-preprocessing/guides/02_jupyter-guide/

## Misc.

original order of running code cells is maintained, (e.g. if you move the cells around and use variables before they are defined), unlike Python where file is read top to bottom.

Use **Restart Kernel and Run All Cells** as the default option

suggested way of showing values in cells is just referencing the variable, specially when working with data frames.

for example

```
c
```

instead of 

```
print(c)
```
